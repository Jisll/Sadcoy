## 🧠 What is important for the Optimizer?

- I put a lot of skill in the optimizer, it should modify the operating system via registry so that it is nicer and smoother to use. 
- The design of the optimizer should be beautiful and good to look at.
- Only registries that are safe and do not destroy the operating system should be used.
- A lot of emphasis is also placed on the code, it should not be messy but fancy so that everything is understood.
